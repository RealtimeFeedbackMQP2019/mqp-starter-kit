# IRB - Human Subjects Research

If your project involves any sort of study or interview with Live People, you need an IRB.

See https://www.wpi.edu/research/support/compliance/institutional-review-board for the latest info.

Specifically, you need:

1) An IRB application, like the example included here
2) Training certificates for all members. Find the Training link on the WPI IRB page.

Coordinate with your advisor to determine whether you need an Expedited or Full IRB. (Essentially, a Full IRB means there is some risk to participants who take part in your study. Most studies can be expedited.)
